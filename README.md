-> created private repository and converted to puplic once done.
-> Q.1: You are part of a development team working on a Python application called "CalculatorPlus." The application provides basic arithmetic operations, such as addition,
        subtraction, multiplication, and division. Your task is to implement a new feature that adds support for calculating the square root of a number.
    a. Create a repository name: git_assignment_HeroVired
    b. Create a ‘dev’ branch and add this code
    c. Merge this branch with the main branch and make a release of version 1 of the ‘calculator plus app’.
    d. Add any of your classmates as collaborators.
    e. Implement a feature by creating a new branch called ‘feature/sqrt’. f. Add the ‘sqrt’ code to it.
    g. While you are working on this feature, imagine that one critical bug is reported in the main branch, and you need to switch back to the ‘dev’ branch, create fixes,
      and apply them while keeping your ‘feature/sqrt’ branch up-to-date. For this, you need to create.The bug fixation is in the divide function.
    h. After completing the feature implementation and ensuring that the application works correctly, create a pull request targeting the main branch.
    i. Request a code review from a team member and make any necessary improvements based on the review feedback.
    j. Once the code reviewer approves your pull request, merge the "feature/sqrt" branch into the ‘dev’ branch.
    k. Finally, do the testing in the ‘dev’ branch itself and merge it into the ‘main’ branch and create a ‘version 2’ release.
